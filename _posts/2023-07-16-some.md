## Introduction 

The circle cutting problem is a famous puzzle that attempts to find the maximum number of pieces formed by N cuts through a circle. This question has been solved numerous times through the euler formula or recursion. This question is an excellent introduction to these ideas and is really cool counting problem. However to those amongst who are really bored, you may wonder what if the circle was in fact a cube and instead of working in the 2D we took it to the real world and made it 3D. Or maybe, some of you may be incredibly bored and may think, what if we generalized this to N dimensions. In other words:

What is the maximum number of "pieces" that can be formed by cutting an N dimensional solid with k cuts?

This questions reveals a very interesting counting relation and is interesting to work through. The solution I will present to you will involve logic, geometry, and a little bit of counting. This solution will also consist of three parts: 2D (recap), 3D, and N dimensions.

### Assumptions 
Before we begin cutting spheres in 4D space we have to lay down a few basic assumptions to solve this problem:
1. Each cut goes on forever and is straight. This essentially just means that we cut straight and don't stop. The cuts don't end or curve for our convenience.
2. The figure we start off with is convex. This essentially means every cut splits a piece in exactly two.  The figure below shows the reason behind this assumption:

![broken heart is split into three pieces. NOT ALLOWED](https://github.com/n-diwan/n-diwan/blob/master/assets/images/heart.png?raw=true)

These assumptions will hold for all dimensions. 
### Rules
There are two rules that we will follow in order to maximize the number of pieces. Both of them are sort of obvious but important. These rules will hold in all dimensions but I will explain them in 2D 
1. Intersection points have a maximum of two lines going through them. This is because if there were three lines going through one, we could just move one line off the intersection point and make another shape. 
2. No lines are parallel. This rule exists because if they were parallel we can move one line so they intersect at a point. This intersection creates another shape. This motivates the idea that to maximize pieces we maximize intersection points

## 2D case
### External vs Internal Pieces
To make our problem a bit easier I define an external piece as a piece that touches the edge of the figure, and an internal piece as a piece that is fully enclosed by other pieces. 
![Red pieces are external pieces, blue pieces are internal pieces](https://github.com/n-diwan/n-diwan/blob/master/assets/images/2d1.png?raw=true)
It is easy to see that:

$$n_{total} = n_{external} + n_{internal} $$

#### External pieces?
To find the number of external pieces we consider \\(k\\) lines going through the center at a single point. There are currently \\$2k\\$ pieces. We then shift each line off center so we comply with the two rules above. Since no new line is going through the external figure, the maximum number of pieces is still $2k$

#### Internal pieces
The number of internal pieces is a bit tricky but we first note that the internal shape at the center of the $k$ cuts is an $k$ sided polygon.
