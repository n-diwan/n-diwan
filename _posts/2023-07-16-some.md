I want to showcase some mathematical equations using LaTeX:

### Quadratic Formula

The quadratic formula is given by:

\[ x = \frac{{-b \pm \sqrt{{b^2 - 4ac}}}}{{2a}} \]

This formula can be used to find the roots of a quadratic equation.

### Euler's Identity

Euler's identity is a fundamental equation in mathematics:

\[ e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0 \]

It connects five of the most important mathematical constants: \(e\), \(i\), \(\pi\), 1, and 0.

Feel free to explore more mathematical concepts and equations using LaTeX in your posts!
