## Introduction 

The circle cutting problem is a famous puzzle that attempts to find the maximum number of pieces formed by N cuts through a circle. This question has been solved numerous times through the euler formula or recursion. This question is an excellent introduction to these ideas and is really cool counting problem. However to those amongst who are really bored, you may wonder what if the circle was in fact a cube and instead of working in the 2D we took it to the real world and made it 3D. Or maybe, some of you may be incredibly bored and may think, what if we generalized this to N dimensions. In other words:

What is the maximum number of "pieces" that can be formed by cutting an N dimensional solid with k cuts?

### Quadratic Formula

The quadratic formula is given by:

\\[ x = \frac{{-b \pm \sqrt{{b^2 - 4ac}}}}{{2a}} \\]

This formula can be used to find the roots of a quadratic equation.

### Euler's Identity

Euler's identity is a fundamental equation in mathematics:

\\[ e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0 \\]

It connects five of the most important mathematical constants: \(e\), \(i\), \(\pi\), 1, and 0.
